# Project History

## 🛠️ About This Project
This project was originally created and developed by **Julian Mayes** in 2024. It includes core functionality such as:
- Audio/video transcription using **Deepgram**
- AI content generation using **OpenAI**
- Full-stack integration with **Supabase** and **Express**
- Frontend built with **React/Next.js**

## 🧹 Why Git History Was Removed
The original Git repository was deleted in 2025 to permanently remove exposed credentials that were accidentally committed.

As a result, this new repository does **not** include the full commit history. The project structure, architecture, and all code were developed independently by the original author and have been re-uploaded cleanly without sensitive data.

## ✅ Proof of Ownership
- Original development began in 2024
- Architecture, codebase, and features were all authored by Julian Mayes
- Local Git logs and screenshots are available upon request
- Commits in this repository will continue under the same author

## 📅 Timeline
- **2024:** Project development and initial commits
- **2025 (June):** Repo reset to remove secrets and re-published to GitHub
